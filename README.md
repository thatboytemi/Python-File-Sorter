# Python Program That Sorts Files into Folders in a Given Directory
## Steps to run:
1) Run the python program
2) You'll then be prompted to enter the directory name of the folder you want to sort (enter its full path)

## Expected output:
If the program did not encounter any errors, you should see the message "Done".
The folder should then be sorted (by extension name) into several subfolders.
